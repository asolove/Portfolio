    <h3>I design and build sites that stretch the web to its limits.
      Because of my work, <a href="#wssr">middle-schoolers are enjoying library books</a>,
      <a href="#ds">scholars better understand two-thousand year-old poems</a>, and 
      <a href="#dhair">cancer patients have longer, more joyful lives.</a></h3>

    <p>When was the last time a web site 
      convinced you of an idea you disagreed with? Or encouraged you to stop
      and reflect on your life? <em>Or did anything, in fact, to make your more human?</em>
    </p>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t yet know what the web wants to be. We are still experimenting
      with its form&mdash;how to communicate, how to persuade, how to educate.</p>
    <p>But we do know where the new ideas will come from, the same place they always
      come from: <em>the marriage of technical mastery, design vision, and human empathy.</em>
      Web designers who want to forge ahead will need to know every cranny of JavaScript 
      and loadtime performance, they will need to understand color theory and typography,
      and they will need to care about the people who use their creations.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last ten years developing precisely those skills.
      <em>Now it&rsquo;s time to do something awesome.</em></p>

    <p>I worked with the program&rsquo;s staff to understand the current, Excel-based process
      and simplify it into a clear online workflow. 
      With a team of my coworkers at 
      <a href="http://www.asee.org/"><abbr title="American Society for Engineering Education">ASEE</abbr></a>, we built the entire site in the course of two months.</p>
    <p>I designed a component library of buttons, typographic styles, and
      patterns for displaying tables, nesting, and hierarchies.
      I developed a rich iconography to display hundreds of applicant preferences 
      and lab assignments in a limited space. And I managed the development 
      and testing of the final application based on my detailed mockups.</p>

    <h2>Deco</h2>
    <h3>Simple, collaborative online moodboarding. For art directors, designers, and developers.</h3>

    </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Deco brings the benefits of design moodboards online, allowing real-time
      collaboration on design research and documentation. Multiple users upload, organize,
      and play with images, videos, and labels until they get a feel for what
      the design should be.</p>
    <p>Using example images improves client communication. Most clients
      don&rsquo;t have the design vocabulary to describe what they want, but can quickly
      judge which examples fit their vision.</p>

    <p>The Deco prototype is also a meditation on how minor advances in web technology
      can lead to major advances in the ease of interaction:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The HTML5 File API allows users to drag images from their computer into 
        the application, rather than having to upload them in a form.</li>
      <li>Multitouch, and <a href="http://scripty2.com/doc/scripty2%20ui/s2/ui/multitouch.html">multitouch emulation with a mouse</a>,
        allow users to directly interact with their images as if they were physical objects,
        rather than working through dialog boxes and form controls.</li>
      <li>Websockets allow extremely fast two-way communication between the server
        and the user&rsquo;s browser, making it possible to interact with no noticeable delay.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The web technology we have now is unbelievable. I designed, prototyped, built,
      and launched Deco, by myself, in just a month. </p>

    <p>My graduate studies centered on Classical Chinese poetry of the third to

    <h3>Recommending children&rsquo;s books to busy parents.</h3>

    <p>My wife teaches middle and high school English, so students and parents
      are always asking her for book suggestions. When we started building a site
      of her book reviews and discussion questions, we considered a lot of ways 
      of navigating: browsing like Amazon, recommendations like Netflix, or categories like Yahoo.
      These systems help users make choices and emphasize the wide range of possible answers.
    </p>
    <p>But parents don&rsquo;t want choices, they already face the thousands of young adult
      books in libraries and bookstores. <strong>So we simplified the site to
      a core dialogue.</strong> Parents ask a question and get one quality answer.
      If their daughter has already read that book, they can ask for another.</p>
      
    <img src="wssr.jpg" width="670px"/>
    <p class="caption">A simple dialogue on 
      <a href="http://whatshouldsheread.com/">What should she read?</a></p>
      
    <p>Because the site is a dialogue, it needs to be polite:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It responds quickly. The server-side code and the web page sent in reply
        have been meticulously tuned for speed. <strong>Only a third of a second</strong> elapses from
        asking a question to the answer fully-rendered on screen.</li>
      <li>It doesn&rsquo;t forget. The second time you visit the home page,
        it greets you with your most recent question and a
        fresh answer you&rsquo;ve never seen before.</li>
      <li>It is humble. It wants to recommend really good books, not brag about
        its extensive collection. Boys and girls mature at different rates, so it only tries
        to provide suggestions for girls. And when it can&rsquo;t find you any more
        helpful answers, it apologizes and tells you where you could go to learn more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rare are the projects that can afford this kind of polish and this 
      level of attention to detail. But when I see the results &mdash;
      girls excited to finish one book and get the next recommendation &mdash;
      I am inspired to spend the same care and instill the same excitement
      into my everyday projects.

    <h3>Helping cancer patients take control of their treatment.</h3>
    <ul class="skills">
      <li>User Experience</li>
      <li><abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr></li>

    </ul>
    <p>During chemotherapy and other cancer treatments, patients are told
      to expect a wide variety of side-effects. Many patients have difficulty
      with their short-term memory, and grow complacent with the expectation of 
      health difficulties, so they never report their problems.</p>
      <p>I was the staff web
      developer on a medical research project that asked patients to regularly
      fill out an online health survey. I built the survey software
      and the algorithms for producing statistical data. I also designed an
      interactive self-help tool for viewing changes in symptoms, making journal
      entries about the treatment, and getting advice on self-care.</p>
      <p>The research results were clear. Patients who regularly and systematically
        thought about their symptoms were more likely to insist on treatment
        and get help from their doctor. Patients who frequently looked at the charts
        of their symptoms often noticed patterns that doctors missed.</p>
      <p>Some of the patients earned months or years on their life and substantially
        reduced the suffering they experienced while in treatment.</p>

    <p>I do a lot of work: in-house, for clients, on contract, as a volunteer.
      Normally someone comes to me with a plan already half thought-out.
      I love to solve their problems, and am glad that even people outside of the programming and design 
      communities have established mental models of what web design can be.</p>

    <p>But occasionally I need to stop normal work, throw away normal metaphors, and
      deconstruct the boxes and form controls that I try to imbue with personality.
      "We are not the web" is a brief interactive essay that expressed some pent-up
      frustration and helped me think through how to broaden my view of web design.
